Credit: The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

First we read them into the working directory
Then clean up the NAs and some obvious columns that has almost nothing to do with the prediction
We tried two different learning methods, Random Forest and Regression Trees, and compare both with the confidence level

Using Random Forest provide the best prediction confirmed by the testing dataset
Finally, we use RF model on testing dataset to get the final prediction.
