## Background

Using wareable devices to find patterns in weight lifting exercise. Tester were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways (A,B,C,D,E). 
The goal of this project is to predict the manner of the test subjects in which they did the exercise.

First, Loading the data 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
if (!file.exists("pml-training.csv")) {
  download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", destfile = "pml-training.csv")
}
if (!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")) {
  download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", destfile = "pml-testing.csv")
}
traindata <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
testdata <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))

# Cleaning the data before split and learn


# Parting training set into learning set and self testing set
library(carat)
train_split <- createDataPartition(y=traindata$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
mytrain <- traindata[train_split, ]
mytest <- traindata[-train_split, ]


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
